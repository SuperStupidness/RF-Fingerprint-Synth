    """
    Creates an APSK modulated signal with rectangular pulse shaping.
    
    Generates either a 16-APSK or 32-APSK signal using random, IID symbols based on
    DVB-S2 standard constellations. The symbols are arranged in concentric rings
    with specific radius ratios for optimized performance. The signal is upsampled
    and filtered with a normalized rectangular pulse shape.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    number_of_constellations : int
        The order of the APSK constellation (must be either 16 or 32)
    number_of_symbols : int
        The number of symbols to generate in the signal
    samples_per_symbol : int
        The number of samples per symbol (oversampling factor)

    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        Complex baseband APSK signal after rectangular pulse shaping
    
    Notes
    -----
    - Uses random, IID symbols with uniform distribution across all constellation points
    - 16-APSK uses 2 concentric rings with 4 inner and 12 outer points 
    - 32-APSK uses 3 concentric rings with 4 inner, 12 middle, and 16 outer points 
    - Ring radius ratios follow DVB-S2 specification for code rate 9/10
    - The rectangular pulse shape is normalized to have unit energy
